    The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element
        - static (default)
        - relative
        - absolute
        - fixed
        - sticky

        - position: static
            - elements are positioned static by default
            - static positioned elemets are not affected by z-index, top, bottom, left, and right properties
            - an element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way;
                it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page

        - position: relative
            - positioned relative to its normal position
            - setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element
                will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position
            - other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element

        - position: absolute
            - positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed),
                i.e., top, right, bottom, and left properties are applied w.r.t to nearest positioned ancestor
            - if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling
            - absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements (gap not maintained)
            - practice:
                - mark nearest positioned ancestor as relative
                - mark the element to be absolute

        - position: fixed
            - positioned relative to the viewport (which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled)
            - top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element
            - fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements (gap not maintained)

        - position: sticky
            - a sticky element behaves like a relative element until a specified scroll position is reached — then it becomes fixed and sticks in place
                (The element scrolls with the page normally at first (like relative)
                Once you scroll far enough, it freezes in place (like fixed)
                But it doesn’t stay stuck forever — only until the parent container ends)
            - sticks only within its parent container.
            - must specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work
            -  a sticky element does not leave a gap when it sticks (even when it becomes fixed) — the gap is already reserved because the element remains in flow

        z-index
            - The z-index property controls the stacking order of elements along the z-axis (i.e., front-to-back, not just left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
            - z-index only works on positioned elements (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky)
            - Higher z-index values = appear on top
            - Lower z-index values = appear behind
